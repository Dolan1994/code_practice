Create a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that:
	-Has a few buttons that do things
	-Changes the background color to yellow if the user presses 'y', red if 'r', and blue if 'b'.
	-Any other flair with HTML and CSS; just a basic beginning thing for the first commit.
Add the files to a folder called 'your_name' and push the folder and files to GitHub.
